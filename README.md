## problem 14

- problem input growing too fast for B (overuse of memory of List())
- array growing over index range (2^32-1)
- counting pairs overflow the pairs and the result
- sequence could have the same letter in the begginning and in the end


## problem 15

- priority queue should keep the entries with the same priority
- generation of the large input should use i%9

## problem 16

- misunderstood how length field should be evaluated
- missed the part where the input might contain irrelevant data (trailing zeroes)
- overflow got me again =(
- multi-packs int parsing failed due to error in shifting 

## problem 17

- partb should include negative velocities for Y
- not many mistakes today, as I brute-forced my way
